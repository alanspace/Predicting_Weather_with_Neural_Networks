    "`MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `Temp9am`, `Temp3pm`: Temperature readings are fundamental to weather. The daily range and specific temperature points help define the conditions for rain.\\\n",
    "`Rainfall`: The amount of rain that fell on the current day. This is a very strong indicator; a rainy day might be followed by another.\\\n",
    "`Evaporation`, `Sunshine`: These measure the sun's effect. High sunshine and evaporation suggest clear, dry conditions, making rain less likely.\\\n",
    "`WindGustDir`, `WindDir9am`, `WindDir3pm`: Wind direction tells the model where the air is coming from (e.g., a moist ocean or a dry desert). The script correctly transforms this cyclical data into sine and cosine values.\\\n",
    "`WindGustSpeed`, `WindSpeed9am`, `WindSpeed3pm`: Wind speed is important because weather systems move with the wind. High winds can bring in new weather fronts quickly.\\\n",
    "`Humidity9am`, `Humidity3pm`: This is one of the most critical features. Humidity is a direct measure of the amount of moisture in the air, which is a necessary ingredient for rain.\\\n",
    "`Pressure9am`, `Pressure3pm`: Atmospheric pressure is a classic weather predictor. Low-pressure systems are strongly associated with clouds and precipitation.\\\n",
    "`Cloud9am`, `Cloud3pm`: The amount of cloud cover. This is also a critical feature, as we can't have rain without clouds.\n",

    "`hidden_layer_sizes = (50,50)`: This defines the architecture of our network. It means there will be two \"hidden\" layers of neurons between the input and output layers, and each of these hidden layers will have 50 neurons. This was an initial guess at a good structure.\\\n",
    "`random_state = 0`: Just like before, this ensures that the random starting conditions of the network are the same each time, making the results reproducible.\n",
    "`max_iter = 500`: This tells the model to stop training after a maximum of 500 iterations (or \"epochs\") through the data. It's a safety measure to prevent the training from taking too long if it doesn't converge on a solution.\n",
    "`nn.fit(X_train, y_train)`: This is the training command. The model iterates through the scaled training features (X_train) and the corresponding answers (y_train) and continuously adjusts its internal parameters (weights) to minimize its prediction errors. This is the \"learning\" process.\n",

    "Other Parameters (activation, solver, etc.): These are other settings for the neural network. Since we didn't specify them, the MLPClassifier used its default values. For example, 'relu' is the standard activation function, and 'adam' is a popular and effective algorithm for optimizing the model's weights."

    "This analysis demonstrates that the simpler model found through hyperparameter tuning not only performed better but is also more computationally efficient. It achieved a higher F1-score for predicting rain, indicating it is better at balancing the trade-off between missing a rain event and falsely predicting one. This highlights the critical importance of model evaluation and optimization beyond simple accuracy.\n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Illusion of Accuracy: The first thing to note is that the overall accuracy is virtually identical (89.3% vs. 89.4%). This proves that accuracy was a poor metric for this problem, just as we hypothesized.\\\n",
    "The Precision-Recall Trade-off: The real story is in the trade-off. The \"better\" model found by GridSearchCV is not strictly better; it simply has a different behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "The simpler (2,) model is more cautious about predicting rain (higher precision). When it predicts rain, it's more likely to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this caution comes at a cost. It is less likely to catch every rain event (lower recall), meaning it misses more rainy days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering the \"Which Model is Better?\" Question: This depends on the real-world application.\n",
    "If we  are a concert organizer, a False Negative (predicting \"No Rain\" when it rains) is catastrophic. We would prefer the first (50,50) model because it has a higher Recall—it's better at catching the rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are an automated irrigation system, a False Positive (predicting \"Rain\" when it's dry) is inefficient but not a disaster (the sprinklers just don't turn on). We might prefer the second (2,) model because its higher Precision means it's more confident when it predicts rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why did GridSearchCV pick the second model? GridSearchCV optimizes an average score (by default, accuracy) over several cross-validation splits of the training data. The (2,) model had the best average performance there. This does not guarantee it will be the best on the single, unseen test set, but it's a very good heuristic. The fact that the performance is so similar shows that both are valid models.\n"
